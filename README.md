# üß© msnchat-bindings

Rust FFI bindings for the legacy **MSN Chat ActiveX control**, reverse-engineered from the original `MSNChat45.ocx`. This crate provides low-level access to the COM interfaces and types used by MSN Chat 4.5-era chat components.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These bindings are raw and unsafe by nature. They are intended for developers working with legacy COM automation, reverse engineering, or historical software preservation.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Raw FFI bindings generated via [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)
- ‚úÖ Compatible with the original `MSNChat45.ocx` ActiveX control
- ‚úÖ Includes COM interface definitions, enums, and constants
- üß™ Ideal for experimentation, automation, or building a safe wrapper layer

---

## üì¶ Usage

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
msnchat-bindings = { git = "https://github.com/msnchatinternals/msnchat-bindings.git", branch = "main" }
```

Then in your code:

```
use msnchat_bindings::bindings::*;
```

You can now call into the raw COM interfaces or exported functions defined in the original OCX.

---

## üõ† Requirements

- Rust 1.70+ recommended
- The original `MSNChat45.ocx` must be registered via `regsvr32` if you intend to instantiate the control

---

## üß† Example (COM Instantiation)

```rust
use msnchat_bindings::ChatFrame;
use windows::core::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize COM (required before using COM interfaces)
    unsafe { windows::Win32::System::Com::CoInitializeEx(std::ptr::null_mut(), windows::Win32::System::Com::COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED)? };

    // Create a new ChatFrame instance
    let chat = ChatFrame::create()?;

    // Set some visual properties
    chat.set_back_color(Some(0x00FFCC))?;
    chat.set_button_back_color(Some(0x003366))?;
    chat.set_button_text_color(Some(0xFFFFFF))?;

    // Set server metadata
    chat.set_server(Some("irc.irc7.com"))
    chat.set_room_name(Some("The Lobby"))?;
    chat.set_nick_name(Some("Ferris"))?;

    // Optionally clear a BSTR property
    chat.set_welcome_msg(None)?;

    println!("ChatFrame configured successfully.");
    Ok(())
}
```
